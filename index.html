                <p>The art style of impressionism was birthed in 1874 and impacted twentieth-century art since. The artist
                who rebelled against traditional academic painting created a new visual language that emphasized light,
                color, and the fleeting effects of nature. These artists, known as impressionists, redefined the cutting
                edge of artistic expression and comtemporary art. Join us as the Frist Museum explores this
                revolutionary movement with pieces from core impressionists Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, and Berthe
                Morisot. Then the avant-garde artists they inspired, Pual Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, Piet mondrian, and
                Henri Matisse. See nearly 50 paintings and sculptures that revolutionized the art world.</p>

            <h4>Impressionism's rebellious origins</h4>
            <p>In the mid-1800's, the Paris art scene was all about making artwork that favored historical,
                mythological, and religious subjects in precise detail. This was very constraining on young artists.
                They wanted to break free from these rules and paint what they saw in everyday life, using loose
                brushstrokes and vibrant colors to capture the momentary effects of light and atmosphere.
                This was life that everyone could relate to, not the lofty and idealized subjects of the academies.
                <br><br>
                The key characteristics of Impressionism include visible brushstrokes, everyday life scenes, an emphasis
                on light, bold and vibrant colors, often painted side by side without blending. With the invention of
                portable paint tubes, artists could now paint outdoors (en plein air), capturing the changing effects of
                light and atmosphere in real-time. This allowed them to experiment with new techniques and perspectives,
                leading to a fresh and dynamic approach to art.
                <br><br>
                Their work was met with rejection early on. Claude Monet's painting "Impression, Sunrise" was ridiculed
                by critics saying it looked like an "impression" rather than a finished piece. However, the term was
                embraced by the artists themselves and "Impressionism" was born.

            <h2>"Impressionism is the cornerstone <br> of all modern art."</h2>

        <div class="overview-inner">
            <h4>Impact on modern art</h4>
            <p>Their work started a precedent to challenge academic traditions, broadening what art can depict, to
                eventually the fundamental level. This was the beginning of artist showing their personal vision and
                perception of life and the world.
                <br><br>
                Impressionism paved the way for various modern art movements, including Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, and
                Cubism. Artists like Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso drew inspiration
                from the Impressionists' innovative techniques and approaches to color and composition.
                <br><br>
                Today, Impressionism remains one of the most beloved and influential art movements in history. Its
                emphasis on capturing the fleeting moments of everyday life continues to resonate with audiences
                worldwide, reminding us of the beauty and transience of our own experiences.
